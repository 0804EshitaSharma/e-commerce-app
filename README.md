## **Project Description:**
Our project is an online store called E-Commerce-App, which is designed for customers to make online purchases, especially for those who are looking for convenience and favor 
online shops over traditional brick-and-mortar stores because of their comfort. It will store data such as product details and user information, so that the consumers can log in to their own accounts and have access to a variety of online purchasing features and services. It also supports the users to read descriptions, view photographs of the products, and check user reviews as they explore through comprehensive product lists. It includes products from a variety of categories, including electronics, apparel, household items, and more, which can be searched for by users. We are also considering functionalities such as creating the seller side of accounts and pages depending on the time constraints.


## Task Breakdown
The following are the two minimal requirements we have chosen to do task breakdowns for and their associated smaller tasks:

- A dashboard with a search bar with product filters

  - Create a search engine that has a side filter that lists categories like Electronics, Groceries, Shoes & Handbags, Luxury Beauty, etc. depending on the mock data.
  
  - Create a top area with a personalized horizontal scroll, and it should automatically show the best offers or show a few products to catch the user's eye.
  
- View selected product details

  - Decide how we want to store picture of product (as base64 string or blob storage or something else)
  
  - Display picture of product, description of product, price of product, quantity left
  
  - Create ‘Add to Cart’ button
