- HTML establishes a web page's structure by logically segmenting the information of our app into individual elements which enhances Accessibility and Search Engine Optimization.
- With the help of Media queries, CSS is in charge of styling HTML elements on a webpage and improving the user experience of our app by making it responsive.
- JavaScript provided powerful tools for managing how the Document Object Model should respond to various user-driven events. 

2. **React & Redux**
React and Redux are used throughout this project to create a robust and maintainable frontend architecture. Compared to standard HTML, our project utilized React components, which efficiently manage the application's UI rendering, promoting code reusability and readability. Redux is integrated into our project to manage a global state, ensuring seamless data flow and facilitating efficient state management across components.

## **Project Description:**
Our project is an online store called E-Commerce-App, which is designed for customers to make online purchases, especially for those who are looking for convenience and favor 
online shops over traditional brick-and-mortar stores because of their comfort. It will store data such as product details and user information, so that the consumers can log in to their own accounts and have access to a variety of online purchasing features and services. It also supports the users to read descriptions, view photographs of the products, and check user reviews as they explore through comprehensive product lists. It includes products from a variety of categories, including electronics, apparel, household items, and more, which can be searched for by users. We are also considering functionalities such as creating the seller side of accounts and pages depending on the time constraints.
